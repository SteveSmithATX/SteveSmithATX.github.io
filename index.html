		<h1>Tailgating is a Passion</h1>
		<p>Tailgating has been a long time obsession for sports fans, though it probably didn't exist to the extremes that it does today. Today's tailgates are held in many different forms and many different places, but I'm only going to tell you about mine and what it has to offer.</p>

		<blockquote>"We May Not Win Every Game... But We Ain't Never Lost A Party" -Larry Wamble</blockquote>
		<p>Some tailgates are open to the public and charge, some are closed groups and some, like mine, are open to the public and free to attend with an RSVP.  I'm able to do this because of sponsors who want to promote their companies or products.  Feel free to <a href="rsvp_today.html">Click Here</a> if you want to RSVP</p>
